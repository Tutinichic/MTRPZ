# Lab2 (Unit tests, CI)

## Description

This application showcases the functionality of a typed list and its capabilities in storing and manipulating data. It allows you to perform various operations such as adding, inserting, deleting, retrieving, cloning, reversing, and clearing data. The initial implementation of the list utilizes built-in arrays/lists for data storage, while the refactored version employs a singly linked circular list. Additionally, the application includes tests that validate the accurate functioning of the implemented list.

## Variant

## Conclusion

Unit tests have proven to be an extremely valuable asset in guaranteeing the accuracy and dependability of my application. By conducting thorough testing, I could promptly detect and resolve bugs while also assessing the application's stability after making changes to the code. Despite the time investment required for writing and running tests, it is a worthwhile endeavor as it enables me to save time in the long run by detecting and resolving issues early on.
